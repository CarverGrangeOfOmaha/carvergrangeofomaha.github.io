    <p>The charter took it's name from Dr. George Washington Carver. Dr. Carver had a thirst for knowledge and helping people. During his lifetime his roles included a chemist, a gardener, a plant breeder, a mycologist, an artist, an education, and a humanitarian. He dedicated his life to improving the lives of the poor in the south through agricultural research. You can read about and see Carver's work in museums, <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/george-washington-carver">online</a> and at a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/gwca/index.htm">national monument</a> dedicated to him in Missouri.</p>
        
    <p>George Carver Washington (1860's to January 5th, 1943), a former slave, was a remarkable midwestern man of historical significance to the world of agriculture and science. George was raised by former slave masters after the abolishment of slavery who also encouraged him to pursue his intellectual dreams in science. At that time schooling was hard to find for black people but after various schools George was able to earn a diploma from Minneapolis High School of Minneapolis, KS.</p>
        
    <p>He found more of the same after being rejected at a KS college for his race at which point he claimed a homestead where he grew crops and fruit trees on 17 acres of land. He found his way north to Iowa where he initially studied art and piano for a short time at Simpson College (Indianola, IA) and then botany at Iowa State Agricultural College where he eventually obtained his masters while doing research in mycology and plant pathology and gained national recognition for his reasearch. He was the college's first black student where he would later become Iowa State's first black professor.</p>
        
    <p>Carver continued his love of crop research at the Tuskegee Institute where the school president, Booker T. Washington asked him to teach. Here he researched and learned the value of crop rotation as a way to avoid soil depletion in crops, specifically cotton. He strove to reach out to fellow farmers in remote by use of mobile wagons meant to educate them in the latest farming techniques.He stayed at Tuskegee for 47 years where he later researched the practice of growing alternate crops sweet potatoes, pecans, soybeans, peanuts among others. But it was the peanut crop that George Carver was most known for.</p>
        
    <p>Through his tireless energy, George added more value to the national agriculture science and educational practices. He worked hard to establish an extension program at Alabama that was modelled after the one at ISU. He continued to find more uses of alternate crops, like sweet potatoes and peanuts that replenished soil depleted from cotton. George became associated with the peanut as sought uses and products for the peanut crop and campaigned for its producats benefits.</p>
        
    <p>His work became nationally know as he became know to Franklin Dealanor Roosevelt, received membership to the Royal Society of Arts, gave talks to the U.S. Peanut association and lobbied for the industry. However, George Carver was a redeeming and honorable character for his belief in breaking racial barriers and curing social ills. He was a man who believed Christian beliefs were the answer for this.</p>
        
    <p>He taught and held dear these 8 tenets</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Be clean both inside and out.</li>
            <li>Neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor. </li>
            <li>Lose, if need be, without squealing.</li>
            <li>Win without bragging.</li>
            <li>Always be considerate of women, children, and older people.</li>
            <li>Be too brave to lie.</li>
            <li>Be too generous to cheat.</li>
            <li>Take your share of the world and let others take theirs.</li>
        </ol>
